Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

       "1) Nvidia (NVDA)\n",
       "- Why: AI compute leader. Dominant position in data-center GPUs powers training/inference for major AI models; strong AI-related demand and expanding software ecosystem.\n",
       "- Catalysts: Enterprise AI deployments, expanding data-center GPU mix, potential product cycles (new GPUs), AI software platforms.\n",

       "2) Microsoft (MSFT)\n",
       "- Why: Cloud strength (Azure) coupled with robust software/services and AI integration across products (Copilot, 365). Sticky enterprise customer base, strong cash flow.\n",
       "- Catalysts: AI-enabled productivity tools, increasing cloud adoption, potential margins expansion; diversified revenue mix.\n",

       "- Take: Core quality tech pick with resilient earnings and steady growth.\n",
       "\n",
       "3) Alphabet (GOOGL)\n",
       "- Why: AI-driven product roadmap (Search, Ads, YouTube, Cloud) with substantial margin potential. Strong balance sheet and cash flow.\n",
       "- Catalysts: AI features boosting user engagement, cloud growth, monetization improvements; potential new services.\n",
       "- Risks: Ad-market sensitivity to ad-tech regulation and macro cycles; regulatory scrutiny in multiple regions.\n",
       "- Take: Compelling mix of AI upside and diversified tech/advertising revenue.\n",
       "\n",
       "4) Apple (AAPL)\n",
       "- Why: Deep ecosystem moat (iPhone, services, wearables). Services growth provides recurring revenue and margins; strong balance sheet.\n",
       "- Catalysts: Services and wearables expansion, potential hardware refresh cycles, ecosystem-driven stickiness.\n",
       "- Risks: Supplier-chain disruption, cyclicality of iPhone demand, regulatory scrutiny on app store economics.\n",
       "- Take: Defensive-quality tech with meaningful upside from services and ecosystem.\n",
       "\n",
       "5) Broadcom (AVGO)\n",
       "- Why: Broad exposure to semiconductors and infrastructure tech with strong cash flow and recurring enterprise/service revenue. Diversified semiconductor end-markets (servers, networking, wireless).\n",
       "- Catalysts: Accretive acquisitions, share repurchases, stable capital returns; exposure to growth areas like data-center and 5G infra.\n",
       "- Risks: Semiconductor cycle sensitivity, large M&A integration risk, regulatory/antitrust scrutiny in some regions.\n",

       "Short answer: frontier LLMs are the current state-of-the-art, top-performing models with heavy alignment and safety work, while LLM base models are the foundational, pretraining-stage models that you can fine-tune or align later. Frontier models sit at the edge of capability; base models are the building blocks you start from.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key differences\n",
       "\n",
       "- What they are\n",
       "  - Frontier LLMs: the latest, most capable models available. They typically combine very large scale with sophisticated alignment (instruction-following behavior, safety, and guardrails) and strong performance across many tasks.\n",
       "  - LLM base models: foundational models that have been pre-trained on broad data with a general objective (usually next-token prediction) and little to no instruction-following or safety alignment baked in by default.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Training and objectives\n",
       "  - Frontier: after pretraining, they undergo instruction tuning or fine-tuning on curated instruction data, and often reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or other safety/alignment steps. They may also be tuned for multi-task performance, longer context, and robustness.\n",
       "  - Base: trained primarily with a generic objective on broad text data. They may not be optimized for following instructions or safety constraints out of the box.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Capabilities and behavior\n",
       "  - Frontier: strong instruction-following, better multi-task generalization, often longer context windows, improved reasoning and consistency, and more reliable safety/guardrails.\n",
       "  - Base: powerful, but less reliable for following complex instructions or staying within safety boundaries without further fine-tuning or prompting tricks.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Alignment and safety\n",
       "  - Frontier: heavy emphasis on alignment, safety filters, and policy-compliant outputs. They are designed to minimize unsafe or unreliable outputs in practice.\n",
       "  - Base: safety and alignment are minimal by default; users typically add their own safeguards or fine-tune for specific uses.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Accessibility and openness\n",
       "  - Frontier: frequently access-restricted or tightly licensed; you pay for access or use through a provider. The actual weights may not be publicly available.\n",
       "  - Base: more often open or openly licensed (e.g., open-source weights) so researchers and developers can inspect, modify, and fine-tune them.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Data freshness and scale\n",
       "  - Frontier: often trained or updated with more recent data and more aggressive scaling (parameters, data, compute) to push capabilities further.\n",
       "  - Base: may use older or broader data and smaller scale, serving as a starting point for custom development.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Multi-modality and features\n",
       "  - Frontier: many frontier models are or become multi-modal (text, images, code, etc.), with sophisticated capabilities across modalities.\n",
       "  - Base: many base models are text-only unless specifically extended for other modalities later.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Use cases\n",
       "  - Frontier: suited for high-stakes, demanding applications where top performance and safety are crucial (enterprise-grade assistants, complex reasoning tasks, comprehensive content generation with safeguards).\n",
       "  - Base: ideal starting point for building specialized tools, research experiments, or custom-tuned agents where you want control over the alignment and cost.\n",
       "\n",
       "What this means in practice\n",
       "\n",
       "- If you need the best possible performance now and can work with restricted access and safety considerations, you’d aim for frontier models (or services that provide them).\n",
